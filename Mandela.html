        <br><b>Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela</b> (/mænˈdɛlə/;[1] Xhosa: [xolíɬaɬa mandɛ̂ːla]; 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African anti-<br>apartheid revolutionary, political leader and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy" target="_blank">philanthropist</a> who served as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_South_Africa" target="_blank">President of South Africa</a> from 1994 to 1999. He was the<br>country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on<br>dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African <br>nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997. 
        
        <p>A Xhosa speaker, Mandela was born to the Thembu royal family in Mvezo, Union of South Africa. He studied law at the University of<br> Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial<br> and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's white-<br>only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, he and the ANC committed themselves<br> to its overthrow. Mandela was appointed president of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the <br>1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was <br>unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African Communist<br> Party (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant Umkhonto<br> we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and subsequently<br> sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state following the Rivonia Trial.</p> 
        <p>Mandela served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island, Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic <br>and international pressure and fears of racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led<br> efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to <br>victory and became president. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised <br>reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights<br> abuses. Economically, Mandela's administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs,<br>also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as<br> mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as secretary-general of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999.<br> He declined a second presidential term and was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and <br>focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.</p> 
        <p>Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Although critics on the right denounced him as a communist terrorist and <br>those on the far left deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for<br> his activism. Widely regarded as an icon of democracy and social justice, he received more than 250 honours, including the Nobel <br>Peace Prize. He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his Thembu clan name, Madiba, and<br> described as the "Father of the Nation". </p>

        <h3>Early Life</h3><hr>
            <h4><b>Childhood: 1918–1934</b></h4>
<p>Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province. Given the forename <br>Rolihlahla, a Xhosa term colloquially meaning "troublemaker", in later years he became known by his clan name, Madiba. His patrilineal<br> great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was king of the Thembu people in the Transkeian Territories of South Africa's modern Eastern Cape <br>province. One of Ngubengcuka's sons, named Mandela, was Nelson's grandfather and the source of his surname. Because Mandela was<br> the king's child by a wife of the Ixhiba clan, a so-called "Left-Hand House", the descendants of his cadet branch of the royal family were<br> morganatic, ineligible to inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary royal councilors.</p> 
<p>Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela (1880–1928), was a local chief and councillor to the monarch; he was appointed<br> to the position in 1915, after his predecessor was accused of corruption by a governing white magistrate. In 1926, Gadla was also sacked for<br> corruption, but Nelson was told that his father had lost his job for standing up to the magistrate's unreasonable demands. A devotee of the<br> god Qamata, Gadla was a polygamist with four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who lived in different villages. Nelson's mother was Gadla's<br> third wife, Nosekeni Fanny, daughter of Nkedama of the Right Hand House and a member of the amaMpemvu clan of the Xhosa.<br> </p> 


<p>Mandela later stated that his early life was dominated by traditional Thembu custom and taboo. He grew up with two sisters in his mother's kraal<br> in the village of Qunu, where he tended herds as a cattle-boy and spent much time outside with other boys. Both his parents were illiterate, but<br> being a devout Christian, his mother sent him to a local Methodist school when he was about seven. Baptised a Methodist, Mandela was given <br>the English forename of "Nelson" by his teacher. When Mandela was about nine, his father came to stay at Qunu, where he died of an undiagnosed<br> ailment which Mandela believed to be lung disease. Feeling "cut adrift", he later said that he inherited his father's "proud rebelliousness" and <br>"stubborn sense of fairness".</p>
<p>Mandela's mother took him to the "Great Place" palace at Mqhekezweni, where he was entrusted to the guardianship of the Thembu regent, Chief<br> Jongintaba Dalindyebo. Although he did not see his mother again for many years, Mandela felt that Jongintaba and his wife Noengland treated <br>him as their own child, raising him alongside their son, Justice, and daughter, Nomafu. As Mandela attended church services every Sunday with <br>his guardians, Christianity became a significant part of his life. He attended a Methodist mission school located next to the palace, where he studied<br> English, Xhosa, history and geography. He developed a love of African history, listening to the tales told by elderly visitors to the palace, and was<br> influenced by the anti-imperialist rhetoric of a visiting chief, Joyi. Nevertheless, at the time he considered the European colonizers not as oppressors<br> but as benefactors who had brought education and other benefits to southern Africa. Aged 16, he, Justice and several other boys travelled to Tyhalarha<br> to undergo the ulwaluko circumcision ritual that symbolically marked their transition from boys to men; afterwards he was given the name Dalibunga.</p>

<h3>Clarkebury, Healdtown, and Fort Hare: 1934–1940</h3>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Young_Mandela.jpg/170px-Young_Mandela.jpg">
<p>Intending to gain skills needed to become a privy councillor for the Thembu royal house, in 1933 Mandela began his secondary education at Clarkebury<br> Methodist High School in Engcobo, a Western-style institution that was the largest school for black Africans in Thembuland. Made to socialise with<br> other students on an equal basis, he claimed that he lost his "stuck up" attitude, becoming best friends with a girl for the first time; he began playing<br> sports and developed his lifelong love of gardening. He completed his Junior Certificate in two years, and in 1937 moved to Healdtown, the Methodist<br> college in Fort Beaufort attended by most Thembu royalty, including Justice. The headmaster emphasised the superiority of European culture and<br> government, but Mandela became increasingly interested in native African culture, making his first non-Xhosa friend, a speaker of Sotho, and coming<br> under the influence of one of his favourite teachers, a Xhosa who broke taboo by marrying a Sotho. Mandela spent much of his spare time at Healdtown<br> as a long-distance runner and boxer, and in his second year he became a prefect.</p>
<p>With Jongintaba's backing, in 1939 Mandela began work on a BA degree at the University of Fort Hare, an elite black institution in Alice, Eastern Cape,<br> with around 150 students. There he studied English, anthropology, politics, "native administration", and Roman Dutch law in his first year, desiring to<br> become an interpreter or clerk in the Native Affairs Department. Mandela stayed in the Wesley House dormitory, befriending his own kinsman,<br> K. D. Matanzima, as well as Oliver Tambo, who became a close friend and comrade for decades to come. He took up ballroom dancing, performed in a<br> drama society play about Abraham Lincoln, and gave Bible classes in the local community as part of the Student Christian Association. Although he had<br> friends who held connections to the African National Congress (ANC) who wanted South Africa to be independent of the British Empire, Mandela avoided<br> any involvement with the nascent movement, and became a vocal supporter of the British war effort when the Second World War broke out. He helped<br> establish a first-year students' house committee which challenged the dominance of the second-years, and at the end of his first year became involved in<br> a Students' Representative Council (SRC) boycott against the quality of food, for which he was suspended from the university; he never returned to<br> complete his degree.</p>

<h3>Arriving in Johannesburg: 1941–1943</h3>
<p>Returning to Mqhekezweni in December 1940, Mandela found that Jongintaba had arranged marriages for him and Justice; dismayed, they fled to Johannesburg<br> via Queenstown, arriving in April 1941. Mandela found work as a night watchman at Crown Mines, his "first sight of South African capitalism in action",<br> but was fired when the induna (headman) discovered that he was a runaway. He stayed with a cousin in George Goch Township, who introduced Mandela<br> to realtor and ANC activist Walter Sisulu. The latter secured Mandela a job as an articled clerk at the law firm of Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman, a company<br> run by Lazar Sidelsky, a liberal Jew sympathetic to the ANC's cause. At the firm, Mandela befriended Gaur Radebe—a Hlubi member of the ANC and Communist<br> Party and Nat Bregman, a Jewish communist who became his first white friend. Mandela attended Communist Party gatherings, where he was impressed that<br> Europeans, Africans, Indians, and Coloureds mixed as equals. He later stated that he did not join the party because its atheism conflicted with his Christian faith,<br> and because he saw the South African struggle as being racially based rather than as class warfare. To continue his higher education, Mandela signed up to a<br> University of South Africa correspondence course, working on his bachelor's degree at night. </p>
<p>Earning a small wage, Mandela rented a room in the house of the Xhoma family in the Alexandra township; despite being rife with poverty, crime and pollution,<br> Alexandra always remained a special place for him. Although embarrassed by his poverty, he briefly dated a Swati woman before unsuccessfully courting his<br> landlord's daughter. To save money and be closer to downtown Johannesburg, Mandela moved into the compound of the Witwatersrand Native Labour Association,<br> living among miners of various tribes; as the compound was visited by various chiefs, he once met the Queen Regent of Basutoland. In late 1941, Jongintaba visited<br> Johannesburg there forgiving Mandela for running away before returning to Thembuland, where he died in the winter of 1942. Mandela and Justice arrived a day late<br> for the funeral. After he passed his BA exams in early 1943, Mandela returned to Johannesburg to follow a political path as a lawyer rather than become a privy<br> councillor in Thembuland. He later stated that he experienced no epiphany, but that he "simply found himself doing so, and could not do otherwise."</p>
